Load Game
-The game has different states: Main Menu, Play, Game Over, etc.

The initial state is the Main Menu
- start new game (Play State)
- quit game (exits program)
- continue with level code (enters Play State at a specific Level)
- view high scores (loads high score list from file)**

Upon entering the Play State, the appropriate Level is initiated

A Level contains:
- splash screen / opening animation & title
- background / environment
- the player(s)
- enemies
- projectiles

Each Level will have a certain set of enemy unit types with their own unique behaviors/weapons,
as well as a boss at the end.  

** Could possibly have player stat progression through the levels **

The player is able to move anywhere on the screen and can fire a primary or secondary(special) weapon. 

Powerups (healing, new weapon, enhanced current weapon, etc.) will be dropped after killing certain enemies or sets of enemies, or possibly
by random chance or at set points within the level.  (or a combination of these, i.e. the 'energy' boost gained later in the first level
of 1943 after killing a squad of red planes)
Powerups can be of limited or permanent(through the end of a level or persistant between levels) duration.

My state manager maintains a list of tasks that must be carried out each game tick.  
Different states are achieved by requesting them of the manager, which then removes 
and adds tasks to the list as required to achieve the desired state.  For example, 
when switching to a paused state, the physics updates will be removed from the task list, 
and the render manager (which maintains it's own list of items to be drawn to screen) 
will be told not to accept any new additions to it's list, and to alter the currently 
held items to be rendered grayscale and add a "PAUSED" graphic to the foreground of the scene.  
While in paused mode, the game basically does nothing other than maintain that paused screen 
and wait for input to unpause.  Similar functions are used to switch to each other state 
required for the particular game by adding and removing tasks from the task list.
